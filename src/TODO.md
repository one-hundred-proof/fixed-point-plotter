- [ ] Make it behave better when frame rate is low.

- [ ] It would be good if we didn't overcalculate sampled points. i.e. we only sampled inside the current view bounds.

- [ ] Allow for sliders to be used to change other parameters in the function

- [ ] Add visual indicators for the sampling bounds e.g. vertical lines
